# liga_mononoki
Mononoki font with some Fira Code programming ligatures

Similar to [Echevarriandre's Mononoki Ligature Font](https://github.com/echevarriandre/mononoki-ligatures)  this font has been patched using [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer).

I have left out all ligatures containing `#` and `?`, `@` `;`, as well as ligatures joining dots.
